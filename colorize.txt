How I automatically "matched" clusters: I used the "disIntensity" method, which was created in part to match pixels with
the nearest mean, to calculate and to find the shortest distance between each mean of each cluster of color and gray images, then I 
used "setClassNumber" to connect the index of the correspond gray cluster with the color cluster.
